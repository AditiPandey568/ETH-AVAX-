# ETH-AVAX
The given Solidity smart contract, named RequireAssertRevertExample, is a simple example demonstrating the use of require, assert, and revert functions for condition checking and error handling in a smart contract. 

# DESCRIPTION-
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It allows only the contract owner to set a value, enforces a minimum value of 100, and prevents setting values greater than 1000, reverting transactions with appropriate error messages when conditions are not met.
